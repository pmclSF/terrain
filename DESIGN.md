# Terrain — Architecture Overview

> **Pre-flight checks for AI/ML systems and the tests around them. Locally, no API key required.**

Terrain is a static analyzer that treats unit tests, integration tests, e2e tests, and AI/ML evals as one dependency graph. It catches prompt-schema drift, train/test leakage, eval coverage gaps, model deprecations, framework-migration blockers, untested exports, and the cross-language cause chains general-purpose tools miss — locally, deterministically, on every PR.

The product story lives in [`docs/PRODUCT.md`](docs/PRODUCT.md). This document is the technical companion: what packages exist, what artifacts they produce, and where the integration boundaries sit.

## Core principles

- **Signals are the core abstraction.** Every finding is a structured signal with type, severity, evidence, and location. See `internal/signals/manifest.go` for the manifest model.
- **The snapshot is the integration boundary.** `TestSuiteSnapshot` (`internal/models/snapshot.go`) is the serialized artifact at which detection, graph construction, impact analysis, and reporting compose. Anything that can serialize into the snapshot inherits graph traversal, impact analysis, and the diagnostic-rendering pipeline.
- **Risk must be explainable.** Risk surfaces are derived from signals with transparent scoring, not opaque scores.
- **Local-first, LLM-free by default.** Terrain runs on a developer machine or CI runner with no accounts, SaaS, or network access required. No LLM API key is ever required. The default configuration makes zero outbound network calls (verifiable via `terrain --print-network`).
- **Privacy boundary.** Aggregate metrics and benchmark exports never expose raw file paths or source code. Adopters with stringent code-confidentiality requirements can set `redact_source: true` in `terrain.yaml`.
- **Two-tier severity.** Detectors are explicitly classified as `gate` (counts toward `--fail-on=*` gate decisions) or `observability` (informational only). The tier is mandatory on every manifest entry — no implicit default.

## Pipeline

```
Repository scan
  → Framework detection + test-file discovery + AI/ML surface detection
    → Snapshot construction (TestSuiteSnapshot)
      → Dependency graph construction (depgraph) — typed nodes + edges with confidence
        → Impact analysis (impact) — change-scoped traversal of the unified graph
          → Rule evaluation — finding emission per the rule catalog
            → Diagnostic rendering (4 surfaces: terminal, JUnit XML, GitHub annotations, Step Summary)
              → Optional SARIF emission for security/* rules
                → CI status check + Tests tab population
```

The dependency graph is the integration boundary for adding detection capabilities. New detectors hook in at the snapshot layer, not at the rule layer.

## Three-surface model

Per `docs/PRODUCT.md` §7 (Architecture — three-surface model), Terrain has three consumer surfaces. All three consume the same artifact (JUnit XML + `findings.json` + the source repo state at the failing commit):

| Surface | Renderers | Interactivity | LLM |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CI** | JUnit XML, GitHub check-run annotations, Step Summary, status check | One-shot, passive | Never |
| **CLI** (`terrain analyze`, `terrain report explain`) | Terminal (cargo-style), JUnit, JSON | Developer-driven; supports follow-up questions | Optional (Ollama default, BYOK, or none) |
| **Agent** (MCP server) | MCP tool responses to Claude Code / Cursor / Apps SDK | Conversational | The agent's LLM (adopter's existing subscription) |

The artifact-as-handoff contract decouples surfaces. The CI surface ships at full quality without LLM features ever existing; the CLI and agent surfaces are additive enrichments.

## Vocabulary

Canonical terms used in this doc and across `docs/PRODUCT.md`:

- **Surface** — point in the codebase where an AI/ML system is exposed (LLM call site, model inference endpoint, feature pipeline, prompt template, training script)
- **Eval** — oracle that produces a verdict on a surface's behavior
- **Metric** — score produced by an eval (rubric score, accuracy, F1, AUC, drift KL, latency, cost)
- **Finding** — single result from one rule, rendered to four surfaces
- **Rule** — configurable detection capability with stable ID (`terrain/<category>/<rule>`), severity default, doc page
- **Tier** — `gate` (counts toward `--fail-on=*`) or `observability` (informational). Mandatory on every manifest entry — no implicit default.
- **Cause path** — chain of graph nodes from a finding's primary location back to the change in the PR that caused it
- **Unified graph** — dependency graph spanning code, tests, surfaces, evals, data, and cross-language edges (bidirectional cause attribution)

## What's stable at 0.2.0

Per `docs/PRODUCT.md` §11 (Stability commitments):

- Rule IDs (`terrain/<category>/<rule>` namespace)
- JSON output schema (`version: 1` on `terrain report pr --json` and `findings.json`)
- `terrain.yaml` schema (versioned `v1`; closed-enumeration for surface types)
- CLI flags
- Artifact format (JUnit XML structure, SARIF for security rules, `findings.json` shape)
- Documented quality bars

All follow the one-cycle deprecation contract per `docs/PRODUCT.md` §14 (Versioning).

## Migration context

Terrain originated as a multi-framework test converter. That migration surface lives in `internal/convert/` and the conversion-subsystem CLI (`migrate`, `convert`, `detect`, etc.). It ships in the same binary as the AI/ML CI gate at 0.2.0 and is stable from the 0.2.0 release tag, but is positioned as a parallel product capability with its own narrative.

Pre-0.2.0 was unstable by design; 0.2.0 is the first release with stability commitments. Adopters using pre-0.2.0 versions treat 0.2.0 as a fresh install.

## Extension architecture

The VS Code extension is intentionally thin. It invokes Terrain's CLI, reads the artifact format (JUnit + `findings.json`), and renders views — no domain logic is duplicated in the extension. At 0.2.0 the extension ships as a Marketplace-published alpha with the minimum capability set documented in [`docs/cli-spec.md`](docs/cli-spec.md). Full LSP-based integration is future work.

See [`docs/vscode-extension.md`](docs/vscode-extension.md).
