# VS Code / Cursor Extension

## Purpose

The extension makes Hamlet intelligence explorable inside the editor.

It is not a separate engine.

The extension should remain a thin client over CLI JSON output.

## V1 / V3 architecture

Flow:
1. extension invokes `hamlet analyze --json`
2. CLI returns a TestSuiteSnapshot
3. extension renders structured views

## Sidebar views

### Overview
Repository-level summary:
- framework inventory
- top health issues
- top quality issues
- migration readiness
- highest-risk areas

### Health
Signals like:
- slow tests
- flaky tests
- skipped tests
- dead tests

### Quality
Signals like:
- untested exports
- weak assertions
- mock-heavy tests
- coverage threshold breaks

### Migration
- migration readiness level
- blocker groups by type
- blocker groups by directory with area assessments (safe/caution/risky)
- blocker groups by owner
- framework summary
- preview affordance (file-level drill-down via `hamlet migration preview`)
- representative examples

### Review
Grouped triage for:
- signal type
- owners
- packages/directories
- migration blockers (first-class grouping)
- confidence/risk bands

## Editor interactions

- diagnostics based on signals
- hover explanations
- migration hints
- future diff previews

## Implementation

Source files under `extension/vscode/src/`:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `extension.ts` | Entry point: TreeDataProviders, commands, CLI integration, state management |
| `types.ts` | TypeScript types aligned with CLI JSON snapshot contract |
| `signal_renderer.ts` | Grouping/filtering helpers (groupByType, groupByOwner, groupByDirectory, reviewWorthy, migrationSignals) |
| `views.ts` | View data builders (buildOverview, buildHealth, buildQuality, buildReview, buildMigration) |

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `hamlet.refresh` | Re-run analysis and refresh all views |
| `hamlet.openSummary` | Open executive summary in terminal |
| `hamlet.openMigrationBlockers` | Open migration blockers in terminal |
| `hamlet.revealFile` | Open file associated with a finding |

### States

All views handle empty, loading, error, and loaded states gracefully.

## Rules

- business logic stays in the CLI/core
- avoid duplicating detector logic
- prefer tree views and standard UI surfaces
- webviews should be minimal or deferred
