# Lovable Release Audit

An honest assessment of what makes Hamlet V3 ready for release, what still needs work, and where confidence is strongest.

## What Makes Hamlet Lovable Now

### Immediate Value

Run `hamlet analyze` in any repository with test files. No configuration, no accounts, no setup. You get structural findings in under 5 seconds. Every other command (`summary`, `posture`, `portfolio`, `impact`, `migration readiness`) works the same way -- point it at a directory and get insight.

### One-Command Insight

`hamlet summary` produces a leadership-ready overview covering posture, risk areas, recommendations, blind spots, and benchmark readiness. It is designed to be pasted directly into a team update or technical debt review.

### Five Memorable Insights

These are the findings that reliably produce "I didn't know that" reactions:

1. **Instability concentrates in a few files.** "3 test files account for 80% of all flaky/unstable signals." Teams treat flakiness as systemic; Hamlet shows it is localized and fixable.

2. **Public API surface covered only by E2E.** "12 exported functions have no unit tests -- only E2E tests exercise them." Reveals structural risk invisible to line-coverage tools.

3. **Migration risk compounded by quality issues.** "src/auth/ has 5 migration blockers AND 3 quality issues. Fix quality first." Cross-referencing migration and quality signals is unique to Hamlet.

4. **One team carries disproportionate risk.** "Team Platform owns 60% of high-risk signals but only 20% of test files." Ownership-aware analysis makes risk concentration visible.

5. **Framework fragmentation creating maintenance burden.** "5 frameworks across 40 test files." Quantifying fragmentation makes invisible maintenance costs visible.

### Evidence Transparency

Every measurement carries evidence strength (strong, partial, weak, none) and states its limitations. A "strong" posture with no data is flagged differently from a "strong" posture with runtime evidence. Hamlet never pretends to know more than it does. This honesty builds trust and differentiates it from tools that emit opaque scores.

### Progressive Disclosure

The command hierarchy follows a natural drill-down:

1. `hamlet analyze` -- signal-level detail, everything at once
2. `hamlet summary` -- leadership-ready overview with prioritization
3. `hamlet posture` -- measurement evidence behind each dimension
4. `hamlet portfolio` -- cost, leverage, and redundancy analysis

Each layer adds depth without requiring the previous one. Users can enter at any level and get value.

## What Still Needs Polish

### Not Yet Available

- **Hosted benchmarking.** Benchmark exports are local JSON files. Cross-repository comparison requires manual aggregation. A hosted service for anonymous comparison is planned but not built.
- **CI plugin.** No native GitHub Action, GitLab CI template, or Jenkins plugin. Users integrate via raw CLI commands in their pipeline scripts.
- **IDE extension.** The VS Code extension concept exists in design docs but is not implemented. No inline annotations, no editor integration.

### Thin but Functional

- **Coverage enrichment UX.** Users must manually locate and pass coverage artifact paths (`--coverage path/to/lcov.info`). Auto-detection of common coverage output locations would improve onboarding.
- **Runtime ingestion UX.** Same issue: `--runtime path/to/junit.xml` requires users to know where their CI writes artifacts. Framework-specific presets would help.
- **Policy authoring.** `.hamlet/policy.yaml` works but there is no `hamlet policy init` command to scaffold a starter policy. Users must write YAML from scratch or copy examples.

### Known Limitations

- Test-to-code linkage is heuristic-based. Some coverage relationships are not detected, and evidence metadata reflects this honestly.
- Code unit extraction is strongest for JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, and Python. Other languages get basic file-level analysis.
- Without runtime artifacts, flaky and slow test signals rely on code-level heuristics (retry patterns, timeout values).

## Strongest User Flows

### 1. First-Run Analysis

**Flow:** `hamlet analyze` on an unfamiliar repository.

**Strength:** Produces framework detection, signal discovery, risk scoring, and posture assessment with zero configuration. The output is scannable and information-dense without being overwhelming.

### 2. Posture Drill-Down

**Flow:** `hamlet summary` shows coverage depth is weak. User runs `hamlet posture` to see measurements. Discovers that 40% of exported code units are untested and 25% of test files have weak assertions.

**Strength:** The drill-down path is natural and each step adds actionable detail. Evidence transparency builds trust.

### 3. Portfolio Review

**Flow:** `hamlet portfolio` reveals 3 high-leverage tests and 5 redundancy candidates. User sees that consolidating 2 redundant E2E tests would reduce CI time by an estimated 15%.

**Strength:** Portfolio intelligence is a novel concept that reframes test suites as investments. The findings are concrete and the suggested actions are specific.

### 4. Migration Assessment

**Flow:** `hamlet migration readiness` shows 2 areas are ready, 1 area has blockers compounded by quality issues. User runs `hamlet migration blockers` to see the specific API usage patterns blocking migration.

**Strength:** Cross-referencing migration blockers with quality signals provides guidance that neither tool category offers alone.

### 5. Impact Analysis

**Flow:** Developer runs `hamlet impact` before a PR. Sees that 3 changed files have no test coverage and 2 changed files are covered only by E2E tests.

**Strength:** Integrates with the existing git workflow. Actionable in the context of a specific code change.

## Demo Readiness

- **Fixtures available.** Four demo fixtures in `fixtures/demos/` cover healthy, flaky-concentrated, E2E-heavy, and fragmented-migration-risk profiles.
- **Golden tests pass.** The test suite validates output format and content against expected fixtures.
- **Output is scannable.** Reports use consistent formatting with section headers, aligned columns, and indented detail. No ANSI color codes -- works in any terminal and copies cleanly.
- **Progressive flow works.** Running `analyze` then `summary` then `posture` then `portfolio` on any fixture demonstrates the information architecture clearly.

## Launch Confidence

**Assessment: Ready for local-first OSS CLI release.**

The core value proposition works: point Hamlet at a repository, get structural test intelligence backed by evidence. The five posture dimensions, 18 measurements, portfolio intelligence, and impact analysis are functional and tested. Evidence transparency and honest limitations differentiate the tool.

The gaps (hosted benchmarking, CI plugin, IDE extension, coverage auto-detection) are all additive features that do not block the core experience. They represent the roadmap, not missing prerequisites.

The strongest risk is onboarding friction for coverage and runtime enrichment. Users who only run static analysis will get value, but the full picture requires passing artifact paths manually. Improving this UX should be a near-term priority after launch.
